# Exploring US births

This is my own exploration of the FiveThirtyEight data on US births. The files are location on [github](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/births).

To save time I have copied the exact description of the data contained in the files:

> There are two files:

> `US_births_1994-2003_CDC_NCHS.csv` contains U.S. births data for the years 1994 to 2003, as provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics

> `US_births_2000-2014_SSA.csv` contains U.S. births data for the years 2000 to 2014, as provided by the Social Security Administration

> Both files have the following structure:

> Header | Definition
> ---|---------
`year` | Year
`month` | Month
`date_of_month` | Day number of the month
`day_of_week` | Day of week, where 1 is Monday and 7 is Sunday
`births` | Number of births


It looks like Github does not surrently support the interactive output format - `r-analysis.nb.html`.
